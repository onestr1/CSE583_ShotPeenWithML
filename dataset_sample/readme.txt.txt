# Dataset 1

The script for dataset 1 generates a dataset of random checkerboard patterns with expansion coefficients assigned to alternating squares in a 5x5 checkerboard grid for material simulations. The script iterates through a predefined number of simulations, creating a unique checkerboard pattern for each. Four different expansion coefficients (0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02) are randomly assigned to the squares of the checkerboard grid. The script prepares the geometry, assigns materials with different thermal expansion properties, and saves the resulting patterns as numerical arrays for reference. For each simulation, a new model is initialized, and relevant boundary conditions and temperature fields are applied. The simulation results are saved, including displacement and stress data, as well as the material distribution for later analysis. The primary goal is to generate a comprehensive dataset to study the effects of material expansion on the checkerboard pattern's mechanical response under uniform thermal conditions.

# Dataset 2

The script for dataset 2 is similar with that of dataset 1 however, it is designed to systematically apply each of the four expansion coefficients (0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02) to one square at a time in a 5x5 checkerboard grid, resulting in 100 simulations (4 coefficients * 25 squares). Unlike the original script, where coefficients are randomly distributed across the grid, this version focuses on isolating the effect of a single coefficient applied to a specific square while all other squares have zero expansion. For each simulation, the script initializes the model, assigns the "zero expansion" material to all squares, and applies the target coefficient to one square. It generates a checkerboard pattern reflecting this setup, saves the coefficient distribution as numerical arrays, and runs the simulation. Results, including displacement and stress data, are saved for each case. The primary goal of this script is to build a dataset where the isolated effect of individual expansion coefficients can be analyzed systematically, offering a controlled environment for studying localized material behavior under thermal conditions.

# Simulation Data Files

Each folder in both datasets contains data generated from a eigenstrain model shot peen FEA simulation. Below is a description of each file and its purpose. 
Each file is saved in npy and csv. Npy is easier to import and manage in python, but csv is easier to visualize outside of python.
