The primary users of this product are professionals in the precision manufacturing field, specifically those involved in the production of critical components like wing spars and turbine blades. They need a fast and accurate tool to assess how these parts respond to shot peening and determine the optimal way to assemble shot-peened components. While these users have a solid engineering background, they may have limited experience with software tools, so they require an intuitive interface that delivers reliable, actionable insights into shot peening effects.

## Mechanical Engineer
Alex is a Mechanical Engineer. They want to predict deformation resulting from shot peening on various parts in a quick, reliable way to optimize the performance and durability of components. Alex will input parameters such as shot peening intensity, angle, duration, and material properties, including the part’s geometry and dimensions. They are highly skilled in mechanical design and material behavior but have limited knowledge in machine learning and statistical modeling.

## Process Engineer
Jordan is a Process Engineer. They want to identify the most effective shot peening recipe for specific geometries by comparing predicted deformations across different configurations. Jordan will input and save multiple shot peening recipes, with settings like shot type, speed, and coverage area, to analyze and refine the process for best results. Jordan is proficient in manufacturing and quality control processes but seeks an intuitive interface for exploring the impact of various shot peening parameters.

## Quality Control Engineer
Taylor is a Quality Control Engineer. They aim to validate the predicted deformations generated by the software against real-world data collected during quality testing. Taylor wants to input observed deformation data from physical testing to improve the model's accuracy over time. They will use reports that compare predicted versus actual results and flag discrepancies for further analysis. Taylor is highly skilled in quality assessment but has minimal experience with machine learning and data science.

## Data Scientist
Sam is a Data Scientist. They aim to continually improve the ML model used to predict deformation from shot peening processes by accessing a robust dataset with historical shot peening data and resulting deformation outcomes. Sam wants to experiment with various algorithms and feature engineering techniques, using performance metrics such as accuracy and error rates to refine the model. They have deep expertise in data analysis and machine learning but seek easy access to relevant domain knowledge to ensure the model’s predictions align with engineering requirements.
