## Data Input Module
Purpose: Collects input data, including geometry specifications (e.g., CAD models) and shot peening parameters (recipe).
Functionality: Accepts geometry files, allows manual parameter entry, and validates data before feeding it into the prediction engine.

## Prediction Engine (ML Model)
Purpose: The core ML model trained to predict deformation based on geometry and shot peening parameters.
Functionality: Utilizes previous FEA data to predict deformation characteristics. Should support retraining as new data is collected.

## Visualization Module
Purpose: Allows users to view the predicted deformation on a 3D model, enabling intuitive understanding of the results.
Functionality: Generates 3D renderings, heat maps, or deformation overlays to highlight areas affected by shot peening.

## Recipe and Result Storage
Purpose: A database or repository to store shot peening recipes, prediction results, and any validation data.
Functionality: Enables users to save, search, and retrieve previous recipes and results, as well as actual deformation data for comparison and analysis.

## Comparison and Analysis Module
Purpose: Provides users with tools to compare multiple recipes and analyze predicted deformations.
Functionality: Allows users to run simulations with different recipes and visualize side-by-side comparisons of predicted deformation results.

## Alert and Reporting System
Purpose: Notifies users if predicted deformation exceeds acceptable thresholds, and generates detailed reports on prediction accuracy.
Functionality: Provides customizable alerts and exports reports in various formats (e.g., PDF, CSV) for process documentation and quality control.
